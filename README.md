# NoXsoftware.pl

My personal self-hosted website.

## About

### Goal

Basically I have a domain and possibility to self-host so I created a website for showcasing my projects and I don't know, CV maybe...
This is also a good opportunity to learn some web development. But still C/C++ rules!!!

### Name

Really just my nickname with software added...

### Hosting

NoXsoftware.pl is hosted on Raspberry Pi using Ubuntu Server and Apache2 with CloudFlare proxy.

## License

NoXsoftware.pl is under [Apache 2.0](LICENSE.md) license and [Common Clause](NOTICE.md).

### Commercial use

No idea why somebody would use website specifically created by me for me. Still feel free to copy, but remember that Common Clause applies.
